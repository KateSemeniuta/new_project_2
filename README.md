<summary>Tips for collapsed sections</summary>

### You can add a header

You can add text within a collapsed section. 

You can add an image or a code block, too.

```ruby
   puts "Hello World"
```

```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```

puts markdown.to_html
